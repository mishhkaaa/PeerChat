# P2P Mesh Chat

A decentralized peer-to-peer chat application built with Python and Tkinter. This application creates a true mesh network where peers communicate directly with each other without requiring a central server.

## üöÄ Live Demo Features

As shown in the screenshots above, the application successfully demonstrates:

### ‚úÖ **Working Mesh Network**
- **3 Active Peers**: Mishka (port 12345), Khushi (port 12346), Mayeraa (port 12347)
- **Real-time Message Broadcasting**: Messages from any peer appear instantly in all windows
- **Network Topology**: Connected peers count shows "2" for each peer, indicating proper mesh formation

### ‚úÖ **Message Flow Verification**
- **Bidirectional Communication**: All peers can send and receive messages
- **Timestamp Accuracy**: Each message shows exact time `[17:51:32]`, `[17:51:39]`, etc.
- **Nickname Display**: Messages clearly show sender identity
- **Message Persistence**: Chat history maintained during session

### ‚úÖ **Advanced Features Working**
- **File Transfer**: Successfully sending `.docx` files across the mesh network
- **Emoji Support**: Emoji reactions (üòä) working in messages
- **Peer Discovery**: Network topology view shows all connected and known peers
- **Command System**: `/help` command displays full command reference

### ‚úÖ **Network Resilience**  
- **Dynamic Connections**: Peers can connect/disconnect without breaking the mesh
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Disconnected peers are properly removed from the network
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection failures

## Features

### Core P2P Functionality
- **True Mesh Network**: Each peer can connect directly to other peers
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No central server required
- **Message Flooding**: Messages propagate through the network with loop prevention
- **Automatic Peer Discovery**: Learn about other peers when connecting to the network
- **Dynamic Network**: Peers can join and leave at any time

### Chat Features
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message delivery across the mesh
- **Nickname Support**: Set and change your display name
- **File Transfer**: Send files directly between peers
- **Emoji Support**: Express yourself with emojis
- **Command System**: Built-in slash commands for network management

### User Interface
- **Clean GUI**: User-friendly Tkinter interface
- **Connection Management**: Easy peer connection setup
- **Network Monitoring**: View connected peers and network status
- **Message History**: Scrollable chat with color-coded messages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Installation
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Start the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

#### 2. Set Up Your Node
1. Choose a nickname when prompted
2. Set your listening port (default: 12345)
3. Click "Start Listening"

#### 3. Connect to the Network
- **To connect to an existing peer**: Enter their IP address and port, then click "Connect"
- **To have others connect to you**: Share your IP address and port with them

#### 4. Start Chatting
- Type messages and press Enter
- Use `/help` to see available commands
- Click "File" to send files to all connected peers

## Available Commands

- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/nick <name>` - Change your nickname
- `/peers` - Show list of connected and known peers
- `/connect <ip> <port>` - Connect to a peer
- `/exit` - Quit the application

## Network Architecture

### How It Works
The application creates a mesh topology where each peer can connect to multiple other peers. Messages are broadcast through the network using a flooding algorithm with loop prevention.

### Message Types
- **Chat Messages**: Regular text messages with timestamps
- **Nickname Changes**: Broadcast when users change their display names
- **File Transfers**: Base64-encoded files sent through the network
- **Peer Discovery**: Share known peer lists when connecting

### Security Features
- **Message Loop Prevention**: Uses unique message IDs to prevent infinite loops
- **Connection Management**: Automatic cleanup of failed connections
- **Input Validation**: Proper handling of malformed messages

## Example Network Setup

### Local Testing (Same Computer)
1. Start first instance, use port 12345
2. Start second instance, use port 12346, connect to 127.0.0.1:12345
3. Start third instance, use port 12347, connect to 127.0.0.1:12346
4. All three can now communicate through the mesh

### LAN Setup (Multiple Computers)
1. Find each computer's IP address
2. Start the application on each computer with different ports
3. Connect peers using actual IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.100:12345)
4. Watch the mesh network form as peers discover each other

## Technical Details

### Protocol
- **Transport**: TCP sockets for reliable communication
- **Message Format**: JSON with length prefixes
- **File Transfer**: Base64 encoding for binary data
- **Threading**: Non-blocking GUI with separate network threads

### Message Structure
```json
{
    "type": "chat_message",
    "message_id": "uuid-string",
    "timestamp": 1234567890.123,
    "message": "[14:30:25] Alice: Hello everyone!"
}
```

### Proven Network Architecture
The screenshots demonstrate a working mesh topology:
```
Mishka (12345) ‚Üê‚Üí Khushi (12346) ‚Üê‚Üí Mayeraa (12347)
      ‚Üë                                    ‚Üì
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ (mesh discovery) ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Message Flow Example** (as seen in demo):
1. Mishka sends: `"hello"` ‚Üí appears in all 3 windows instantly
2. Khushi responds: `"how are you doing"` ‚Üí broadcasts to Mishka and Mayeraa  
3. Mayeraa replies: `"very good"` ‚Üí received by both peers through the mesh

**File Transfer Example** (as demonstrated):
- `isro.docx` file sent from one peer
- All connected peers receive the file simultaneously
- Users can choose save location via standard file dialog

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure firewall allows the application
- Check that ports are not already in use
- Verify IP addresses are correct
- Try different ports if default is blocked

### Performance Considerations
- Message flooding scales with network size
- File transfers use base64 encoding (larger than binary)
- Each peer maintains all connections directly
